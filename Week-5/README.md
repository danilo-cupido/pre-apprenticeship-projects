## Week 5

### Git and GitHub

### Linting and formatting

- [x] Install [Prettier](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-format-code-with-prettier-in-visual-studio-code) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started). Ensure both are running by default and keep a consistent coding standard across your project.
