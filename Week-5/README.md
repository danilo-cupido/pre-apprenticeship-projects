## Week 5

### Git and GitHub

- [x] Continue to expand your learning repository and keep committing at least once a day.

### Linting and formatting

- [x] Install [Prettier](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-format-code-with-prettier-in-visual-studio-code) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started). Ensure both are running by default and keep a consistent coding standard across your project.

### Project

Your [project](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/pre-app-5/project/) this week is to work together with your assigned partner on a set of user stories. We’ve estimated how long each one should take.

Focus on reading and reviewing each others’ code before merging pull requests. Reflect on the challenges of working together and what you’ve learnt from pairing on a project asynchronously.

### Spikes

This week there is one [tech spike on checking our code](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/pre-app-5/spikes/).
