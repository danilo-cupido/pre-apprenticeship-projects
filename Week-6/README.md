## Week 6

### GitHub

Upload your learnings from this week onto your learning repository.

Now that you’ve code reviewed someone else’s code, you can review and refactor your own site. Consider the architecture of the site, the focus and what you want to show off to visitors.

Pair up and review one anothers’ sites too.

### Project

Continue working on your digital agency site in pairs. Have a look at the [new User Stories](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/pre-app-6/project/) and work on them this week.

### Execute Program

Keep up with your daily practice on Execute Program.

### JavaScript30

Continue working on JavaScript30 Projects. We suggest taking a look at these two:

- JS30: Object and Arrays - Reference VS Copy
- JS30: Sorting Band Names without articles

This week’s [project](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/pre-app-6/project/) take precedence over JavaScript30 projects. Focus on delivering on your features there before completing additional projects.

### Spikes
