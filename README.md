## Week 12

In this Wednesday’s session we started the [TDD array methods workshop](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/workshops/tdd-array-methods/).

### TDD Array Methods

- [x] Try to implement some more of the array methods in this workshop. Don’t worry if you don’t have time to finish them all.

### Project

- [x] Finish writing your [To-do project](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/pre-app-12/project/). You should already have failing tests written—now is the time to write the code to make those tests pass.
