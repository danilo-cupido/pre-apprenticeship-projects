## Week 1 

### Software installation: 
- [x] Git
- [x] Node
- [x] npm
- [x] iTerm2
- [x] VS Code
- [x] Chrome/Edge/Firefox

### Terminal 
- [x] Work through [Digital Ocean’s Command Line Primer](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/a-linux-command-line-primer). 
- [x] Practice using Terminal to navigate the computer for the other tasks of the week. 

### HTML 
- [x] Work through [Semantic HTML workshop](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/workshops/semantic-html/) to practice using more descriptive elements rather than divs and spans.
- [x] **Challenge** *re-write an HTML page to use semantic HTML. Try to replace as many generic elements with more descriptive semantic ones. Once done it should contain no <div>s at all.*

### A11y 
- [x] Work through the [Learn Accessibility workshop](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/workshops/learn-a11y/) to practice building sites for everyone.
- [x] **Challenge** *identify and fix a11y problems on [this example page](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/workshops/learn-a11y/starter-files/). The page contains 11 failures; try to find them all.*
1. *Re-read [The A11y Project’s Checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/) before you start so you can identify obvious WCAG violations.*
2. *Don’t forget to use Chrome’s Lighthouse tab to find easy problems.*
3. *You’ll have to manually test with your keyboard and screen reader to find some of the issues.*

### Projects 
- [x] Sign up for [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) and work on the first two projects:

- [ ] JavaScript Drum Kit
- [ ] CSS + JS Clock

*Focus on using Semantic HTML, ensuring the sites have 100% in a Lighthouse Accessibility audit, and manually testing the accessibility.*

- [ ] Add the websites into your project collection as well as some notes on what you’ve learnt while building them.

### Git/GitHub 
- [x] Have a look at the structure of [this repository](https://github.com/fac22/project-collection) and create your own version on your own profile.

### Markdown 
- [x] Read [GitHub’s Markdown introduction](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Practice your Markdown by writing a README.md for your learning repository. Try to include some headings, lists, images, and maybe even a table.

### Execute Program 
- [x] Work on [Execute Program](https://www.executeprogram.com/) every day. Start with the **Modern JavaScript** and **Arrays** sections.

### Employment 
- [x] Get active on Twitter.

### Research homework 
- [ ] Look into how to implement ES6 array methods, like map, reduce, filter and forEach, using just a for-loop. Choose one as a challenge for next week in the role of coach.

### Search for “Jackson Gabbard” 
- [x] Find his blog and YouTube channel and spend some time with them.

### Optional homework 
- [ ] Attempt to create a script that generates 11 combinations of 4 groups of 3 people, so that any two people share the same group exactly twice and no three people are in the same group more than once. No group should be majoritively male.
